    <h1> My special rice recipe</h1>
    <h2> Advisor Ndane Ndazhaga</h2>
    <article> Here's a sure way to prepare a delicious
        rice. Measure two cups of rice, Put a jug of water on the fire <br> and allow to boil
        add your rice into the water and let it cook till the water is soaked up in the rice.
  <br><b>Bring down</b> the rice and wash with cold water. This is to remove the starch from the rice.
  <br>Boil some water and add salt to taste. Pour the rice in to the salted water ensure the water level is same 
  <br>as the quantity of rice. Cook till the water dries off from the rice.
  <br>The rice is ready to eat. Serve and eat with and soup or stew of your choice.</article>
